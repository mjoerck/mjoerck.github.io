This is a collection of my personal open-source projects that are internet friendly. Any non-browser-friendly projects will not be featured here. Unfortunately. :(

## Smart Home
- [Temperature/Humidity]() - MQTT enabled sensor. Still **WIP**, link is coming soon.

## Scripts
- [Gmail Cleaner](https://github.com/mjoerck/Gmailcleaner) - A small Google Apps Script which automatically clears out old unwanted emails.
