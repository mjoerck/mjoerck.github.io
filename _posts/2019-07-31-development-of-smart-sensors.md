Hi! And welcome to my GitHub website. This is where you can stay updated on my cool projects and how I am working on simplifying DIY smart homes.
I am currently working on creating very cheap temperature and humidity sensors which can be connected to openHAB, Home-Assistant.io, Google Home and more services.

The exciting thing is how these sensors only cost around $4 each to build yourself, or alternatively it will be possible to buy them quite cheap from me. I am still working on how I would setup a shop and the logistics behind it. So that is very much still a work in process project.
But back to the main point of this blog post, the sensors. I will make all the plans(PCB design, parts etc.) and code free to download from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mjoerck), so stay tuned for that!

Thanks for checking my page out, I hope to see you again!
