According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair) the right to repair electronics refers to the government legislation that is intended to allow consumers the ability to repair and modify their own consumer electronic devices, where otherwise the manufacturer of such devices require the consumer to use only their offered services.

### So why should we care?

Take a moment to look around you, how many electronics and gadgetry can you spot? If one of them were to break what would you do with it, maybe you would pay the expensive repair costs the manufacturer charges, because this item is clearly not worth throwing out, right? Well, it depends.
Some manufacturers cost of repair are almost the same as or slightly less than the price of an entirely new product. So it is clearly not worth paying to have these devices or electronics repaired but what if you could repair them yourself? Great news! You can repair your electronics yourself.

While it is actually not very difficult to get started with repairing electronics many people seem to think that it is almost an impossible task. So here are some tips on what you need to get started.

### What you need to get started with repairing
1. [Proper tools](#proper-tools)
2. [A workspace](#a-workspace)
3. [Knowledge](#knowledge)

The list is not even that long! You can click the links above or scroll to read about the individual parts.

#### Proper tools
The tools you are going to need for a repair varies with the item you are trying to repair. If its a phone that needs to be repaired, you would need a set of specific screwdrivers for the task. As an example you could get [this kit](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307), this specific kit includes pretty much everything you would ever need for most electronics repairs; however, every once in a while some odd screw will need a specific screwdriver and you will just have to deal with it. It is definitely still cheaper than having it repaired by the manufacturer.

At some point you will probably need a soldering iron or some other related items. I will not recommend any tools beside the kit above, but I will say that you should definitely buy proper tools in the beginning, it will save you a lot of time and hassle as you delve into repairs.

#### A workspace
You will need a place to work on you repair projects, many people mistakenly seem to think that you need an entire garage devoted to repairs and nothing else, this is not true! It definitely will be easier if you have a space dedicated to repairing it is not a necessity. Your repairing workshop could be in your living room once a month on the kitchen table, it really does not matter where you repair, just do it! ;)

#### Knowledge
The most important part about repairing is your knowledge, you will need to educate yourself. Even the best repairmen will need to look stuff up every once in a while, so do not hesitate! If you ever find yourself wondering about how a mechanism works or how the inner electronics of a phone is connected you should just Google it. I can guarantee that there is knowledge about your particular item somewhere on the internet. Some of the places I like visiting to gather knowledge before a repair includes:

In no particular order:

- [Ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide) - they have an entire part of their website dedicated to repair guides.
- [Reddit - fixit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/) - there are actually dedicated subreddits for particular devices, but this is a general repair subreddit.
- [Reddit - AskElectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/) - this subreddit is dedicated to electronics.

When you have learned enough from repairing or disassembling electronics you can even begin to create and make your own; however, I think the making of electronics deserves its own blog post.

So what did you learn? You can and should repair your own electronics. It is not that hard to get started with, but you will have to study a bit online. You do not need any particular tools, but I do recommend buying a nice kit of screwdrivers. Repairs can take place anywhere, you do not need a dedicated workshop although it would be nice if you have the space to spare. And last but not least you will never know everything there is to repairs. Online forums and Google will be your best friends in the journey of repairing your own electronics and devices.
