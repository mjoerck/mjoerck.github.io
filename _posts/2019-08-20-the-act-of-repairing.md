According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair) the right to repair electronics refers to the government legislation that is intended to allow consumers the ability to repair and modify their own consumer electronic devices, where otherwise the manufacturer of such devices require the consumer to use only their offered services.

### So why should we care?

Take a moment to look around you, how many electronics and gadgetry can you spot? If one of them were to break what would you do with it, maybe you would pay the expensive repair costs the manufacturer charges, because this item is clearly not worth throwing out, right? Well, it depends.
Some electronics prices of repair are almost the same as or slightly less than the price of an entirely new product. So it is clearly not worth paying to have these devices or electronics repaired but what if you could repair it yourself? Great news! You can repair your electronics yourself.

While it is actually not very difficult to get started with repairing electronics many people seem to think that it is almost an impossible task. So here are some tips on what you need to get started.

### What you need to get started with repairing

- 1. [Proper tools](#Proper-tools)
- 2. [A workspace](#A-workspace)
- 3. [Knowledge](#Knowledge)

The list is not even that long! You can click the links above or scroll to read about the individual parts.

#### Proper tools
The tools you are going to need for a repair varies with the item you are trying to repair. If its a phone that needs to be repaired, you would need a set of specific screwdrivers for the task. As an example you could get [this kit](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307), this specific kit includes pretty much everything you would ever need for most electronics repairs; however, every once in a while some odd screw will need a specific screwdriver and you will just have to deal with it. It is definitely still cheaper than having it repaired by the manufacturer.

#### A workspace
You will need a place to work on you repair projects, many people mistakenly seem to think that you need an entire garage devoted to repairs and nothing else, this is not true! It definitely will be easier if you have a space dedicated to repairing it is not a necessity. Your repairing workshop could be in your living room once a month on the kitchen table, it really does not matter where you repair, just do it! ;)

#### Knowledge
The most important part about repairing is your knowledge, you will need to educate yourself. Even the best repairmen will need to look stuff up every once in a while, so do not hesitate! If you ever find yourself wondering about how a mechanism works or how the inner electronics of a phone is connected you should just Google it. I can guarantee that there is knowledge about your particular item somewhere on the internet. Some of the places I like visiting to gather knowledge before a repair includes:

In no particular order:

- [Ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide)
- [Reddit - fixit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/) - there are actually dedicated subreddits for particular devices, but this is a general repair subreddit.
- [Reddit - AskElectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/) - this subreddit is dedicated to electronics.
