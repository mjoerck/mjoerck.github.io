If you invest in individual stocks, you are making your potential gains troublesome. By picking individual stocks you undertake another dimension of hassle, timing. You can invest in the wrong stocks at the right time, or in the right stocks at the wrong time. Thereby any stock picking skills are undermined by timing aka **luck**. In other words, there is no such thing as definite stock picking skills; however, you can make qualified guesses about the potential of certain stocks. In this post I will be focusing mostly on the fun aspect of stock picking, I am not really interested in insisting that individual stock picking is the best for long term gains. It is not in my opinion.

### Stock picking is fun
As stated above, I only invest in individual stocks because I find it fun and challenging. I like the idea about investing in a stock because you believe in the company. In other words the potential gains are secondary to the growth and advancement of the stock and company. By investing in individual stocks I feels as if I am a part of that company. I like to think of them as my stock-babies, haha.

Besides the fun encompassed in individual stocks I will not deny that you can see great gains quickly by investing in individual stocks; however, it is worth noting that the risk you assume by individual stock picking is much greater than if you invest in ETFs and indexes.

When I stock pick I primarily look at stocks in the medical sector, mostly companies that conduct research in cancer treatment. I would love if we as a species were able to defeat cancer, - I think this is the next great step in medicine. With my individual stock picking I am trying to make a difference all fellow human beings, for Earth and for the world. I would urge you to think about sustainability and the future too.

### From numbers to stocks
Depending on the stock, I usually investigate the metrics and numbers of the stock thoroughly; unless it is a start-up or that I believe in the project - then I will let the stock off lightly. Before taking a closer look at the numbers I try to acquaint myself with the company's products or how the company creates revenue. If I do not understand how the company will create revenue, I will not even look at the metrics. I whole-hearted believe that one should only invest their time and money into a company they understand fully.

1. Normally, I start by scrutinising the executives' experience, previous jobs and efforts. If I conclude that the executives have got a satisfactory amount of experience I proceed to the next step.

2. Next up, I look at the Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E ratio), which is useful to indicate whether the company is over- or undervalued. I usually look at companies with P/E ratios under 40; however, this ratio varies a lot depending on the industry and other parameters.

3. The Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B ratio)  
    > The price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio measures whether a stock is over or undervalued by comparing the net value (assets - liabilities) of a company to its market capitalization. Essentially, the P/B ratio divides a stock's share price by its book value per share (BVPS). The P/B ratio is a good indication of what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's net value.  

    > A P/B ratio of 0.95, 1, or 1.1 means the underlying stock is trading at nearly book value. In other words, the P/B ratio is more useful the greater the number differs from 1. To a value-seeking investor, a company that trades for a P/B ratio of 0.5 is attractive because it implies that the market value is one-half of the company's stated book value. Value investors often like to seek out companies with a market value less than its book value in hopes that the market perception turns out to be wrong. By understanding the differences between market value and book value, investors can help pinpoint investment opportunities. - [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/five-must-have-metrics-value-investors.asp{:target="_blank"}  

    The above-mentioned explanations are from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/){:target="_blank"}, a splendid website for newcomers to the world of investing. If the P/B ratio seems solid I move on to the next step.


4. Subsequently, I screen the company's debt by looking at the Debt-to-Equity ratio (D/E ratio). A high D/E ratio shows that the company derives more of its financing from debt relative to equity and vice versa. I dislike companies that has got a lot of debt; however, I do not mind a little bit of debt, especially not if it is a start-up or a medical adventure.  

5. Lastly, I study the company's balance sheet, free cash flow (FCF) and the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio.
I will not write anything about these here as all of the listed metrics deserve a greater explanation to understand; thus I will leave some links here where you can learn more about said metrics:

- [Balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp#:~:text=A%20balance%20sheet%20is%20a,and%20evaluating%20its%20capital%20structure.){:target="_blank"}
- [FCF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp){:target="_blank"}
- [PEG ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp){:target="_blank"}

Once I have found that all of the numbers add up I will conclude that the company is a solid investment; however, now is the tricky part. When should I jump in and buy the stock? I firmly believe that time in the market beats timing the market, thus I do not concern myself too much with timing, unless it looks like the stock is on a peak, - then I will obviously wait until it declines again.

### A waste of time
So why do I find individual stock picking to be a "waste" of time? As stated in the introduction of this post, I do not like that I have to try and time the market. Therefore, I mostly invest in value stocks - you probably already figured it out reading the above. By picking a value stock I can be at ease knowing that no matter whether I timed the market optimally I will have some gains in the future. But why do I not just stick to value stocks then? The answer is simple. Diversification. If I invest 1000$ in e.g. Google, the health of my wealth is entirely dependent on the health of Google, whereas if I invest in the S&P500 index, my wealth is spread across 500 of the biggest companies in the USA, consequently, a lot can go wrong before my wealth is at risk, - plus I will also see more consistent gains moving forward. The S&P500 index has historically grown with around [8% per annum](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm){:target="_blank"} and it will most likely continue to do so in the future.
