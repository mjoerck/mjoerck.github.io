Welcome to the first post in a series of how to make MQTT sensors. In this post we will be focusing on the making of a door/window sensor that will detect the status of anything openable with hinge. I primarily use it for my doors and windows in my home. Once we are done with the project you will be able to display whether a door is opened or closed in your OpenHAB installation. I would also like to thank Matt Kaczynski from [MK-SmartHouse](https://www.mksmarthouse.com/) whose design and code we will be using for this guide. You should go check his page out. In the future we will also be using my own designs and code, but I am a firm believer that you should not do anything over if you cannot do it better, therefore we will be using his design today.

### The start
I started by gathering the necessary items from Ebay, the complete list of materials can be found [here](https://www.mksmarthouse.com/door-sensor-hardware). I then waited the many months for the items to be shipped and arrive from China. As I live in Denmark the there is quite a long shipping time, the packages are often also stuck in customs duty for days. While I waited I purchased a respected soldering iron, I personally felt like the TS100 was the best soldering iron for me, as I needed one I could easily bring with me and run from batteries.
