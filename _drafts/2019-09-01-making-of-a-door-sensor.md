Welcome to the first post in a series of how to make MQTT sensors. In this post we will be focusing on the making of a door/window sensor that will detect the status of anything openable with hinge. I primarily use it for my doors and windows in my home. In your OpenHAB it will display whether the door is opened or closed.
