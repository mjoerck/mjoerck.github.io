I enjoy writing code, primarily for my own sake, but I also love sharing it to the world, so may be helped in their coding endeavors. I therefore have a bunch of open-source projects at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mjoerck), which you should definitely check out.

I am addicted to biking, photography at any given (and non-given) moment.

# Help funding my electronic projects
If you want to show your support for any of the open-source projects I devote my time to, here is a link to [my patreon]() - I have not added the link yet, stay tuned.
