I enjoy writing code, primarily for my own sake, but I also love sharing it to the world, so may be helped in their coding endeavors. I therefore have a bunch of open-source projects at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mjoerck), which you should definitely check out.

I am addicted to biking, photography at any given (and non-given) moment. If you wish to take a look at my photography you can do so [here](https://mjoerck.com/). I primarily focus on portraits, but I also enjoy travel, street and nature photography.

# Contact
If you wish to contact me, you can shoot me an email: [mjoerck@protonmail.com](mailto:mjoerck@protonmail.com).

# Help funding my electronic projects
If you want to show your support for any of the open-source projects I devote my time to, here is a link to [my patreon]() - I have not added the link yet, stay tuned.
